    <h2 class="text-center">FIRST STEPS</h2>

    among private owners. We seek to provide a smooth rental between the owner and the
    tenant, promoting affordable prices - even when dealing with professionals! We want you to

    with any and all problems throughout your adventure.</P>
    <h3 class="text-right">HOW DO I SIGN UP? IS THE REGISTRATION FREE?</h3>

    platform... and that\'s it! Registration at Banana Campers is intuitive, fast and completely free.
    Be part of our community and discover a world of opportunities</P>
    <h3 class="text-right">WHAT CHARGES ARE APPLYED WHEN I RENT THROUGH BANANA CAMPERS?</h3>
    <P>The reservation is only confirmed after you paying the owner. Until then, you are free
    to search for vehicles on the platform, find out about each one and learn a little more about
    what everyone has to offer - all of this completely free of charge. There is no compromise
    while looking for your dream vehicle.</P>
    <p>The price shown on the page is the total amount, and already includes the
    remuneration the owner will receive and the costs of Banana Campers services (we have a 13% fee that aims to remunerate all the elements of our team that contribute for the
    functioning of the site and that assist you in case of problems or doubts during the rental).</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT VEHICLE?</h3>
    <p>First, keep in mind the type of trip you want to take and also your personal taste.
    There are those who do not miss the comfort of a motorhome and its associated amenities,
    and there are those who prefer a more practical vehicle just to rest after a day of adventure.
    Some will prefer a campervan because it is smaller and more like a regular car, others do not
    mind driving a vehicle the size of a motorhome.</p>
    <p>Also, imagine that you want to take a trip to the mountains: is a vehicle as big and
    heavy as a motorhome ideal for those tight turns? Or do you prefer a smaller, lighter vehicle?
    If you want to stop somewhere along the coast and watch the sea, is it worth not enjoying the
    innate comfort of a motorhome?</p>
    <p>We have at your disposal a selection of filters that you can apply in your search,
    depending on your personal tastes, and that will increase the probability of finding a vehicle
    with all the requirements you are looking for (from the number of seats, to the equipment, to
    the type of vehicle and up to the price).</p>
    <p>When you find one that you really like, you can send a reservation request to the
    owner. This order is without any commitment! It is only valid after paying the amount on our
    platform, even if the owner accepts it. However, we take the opportunity to mention that,
    after the owner accepts the request, he has 48 hours to make the payment if he really wants to
    keep the reservation of that vehicle.</p>
    <h2 class="text-center">INSURANCE AND ASSISTANCE</h2>
    <h3 class="text-right">CAN ANYONE RENT ANY VEHICLE?</h3>
    <p>No. For the safety of both sides, we have defined a set of criteria: the lessee must be
    25 years of age or older, to be verified when submitting documents on the platform; hold a
    driving license, which you have held for at least 3 years; make exclusively private use of the
    vehicle you rent (that is, you cannot sub-rent a vehicle that has been rented).</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">HOW DOES INSURANCE AT BANANA CAMPERS WORK?</h3>
    <p>At the moment, we are working with our partners in Portugal to find an own damage
    insurance solution with affordable prices for the rental of motorhomes and personal vans.
    Soon we will make available all the information regarding the insurance that your vehicle will
    be subject to while rented under Banana Campers.</p>
    <p>Even so, all vehicles registered with Banana Campers must have a valid insurance
    document, and this will be in effect to proceed with the car rentals. The lessee must be
    previously informed of the conditions covered by the policy in force, namely the deductible,
    if it is an insurance against all risks, what is the policy of travel assistance, etc.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">WHAT IS THE DEPOSIT?</h3>
    <p>Also called the security deposit, the guarantee corresponds to a monetary value that
    the lessee delivers directly to the owner, and that allows the latter to cover possible damage
    caused during the rental (such as damage to vehicle structures or equipment, to replace
    everything that does not appear in the inventory upon return, cover the excess of kilometers
    made in addition to those agreed, passages in Via-Verde / tolls / porches, fines, etc.).</p>
    <p>Each owner has their own deposit amount - there is no minimum or maximum
    amount - but count between € 400 and € 2000. The deposit must be paid in cash, bank
    transfer or PayPal on the day of collection of the vehicle and the amount paid must be
    specified in the rental agreement. In case of bank transfers, pay attention to the transfer
    authorization times (banks can take about 3 working days to execute interbank transfers).
    Therefore, the amount of the deposit must be available in the account of the owner on the
    day of collection, so we advise a prior transfer. Anyway, be accompanied by proof of the
    same.</p>
    <p>If, on the day of return of the vehicle, <strong>no anomaly or failure</strong> in the inventory listing is
    detected, the deposit must be returned in full to the tenant.</p>
    <p>However, keep in mind the values that can be communicated to the owner after the
    end of the rental: tolls / porches, fines, etc. In such cases, the owner has the right to contact
    you again to regularize these values. If the fuel tank is not delivered at the level agreed on the
    date of departure, the owner can also withhold the amount that will make it the same (after
    presenting the receipt as proof).</p>
    <p>If, on the day of return of the vehicle, an anomaly or failure in the inventory listing is
    detected, the owner is entitled to retain the deposit in full and the amount equivalent to all If, on the day of return of the vehicle, an anomaly or failure in the inventory listing is
    detected, the owner is entitled to retain the deposit in full and the amount equivalent to all</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF BREAKDOWN AND / OR ACCIDENT?</h3>
    <p>Contact the owner immediately and be as detailed as possible. Remember that the
    owner knows how the vehicle works and will need all the information to remotely try to
    understand what is causing the problem. In case of an accident, you must inform the owner
    and then alert the competent authorities. Please contact Banana Campers right away.</p>
    <p>The activation of the vehicle insurance is the responsibility of the owner, being the
    owner of the vehicle. Remember to take pictures, record in video form - any details you
    consider relevant.</p>
    <p>You must send all these files to Banana Campers, through our email
    suporte@bananacampers.pt</p>
    <h2 class="text-center">CHANGES TO RENTAL CONDITIONS</h2>
    <h3 class="text-right">WHAT DOCUMENTS DO I NEED?</h3>
    <p>A maximum of 48 hours before vehicle collection, the following documents must be
    submitted and validated by Banana Campers on the platform:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Identity Card / Passport (front and back);</li>
    <li>Identity Card / Passport (front and back);</li>
    <li>Identity Card / Passport (front and back);</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Documents can be introduced on the platform through photography (jpeg or png) or
    PDF document, with a maximum of 1Mb per document. We also inform you that the
    documents must correspond to the person who created the account on the Banana Campers
    platform.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">HAS MY DRIVING LICENSE TO BE PORTUGUESE?</h3>
    <p>No. Any driving license issued in member countries of the European Union (EU) is
    valid throughout its territory. This therefore means that foreign citizens with driving licenses
    from other EU countries can drive in Portugal and Portuguese citizens with Portuguese
    driving licenses can drive in all EU member countries.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">WHAT DO I NEED TO HAVE WITH ME ON THE DAY THE VEHICLE IS PICKED UP?</h3>
    <p>We will send your copy of the rental agreement in advance. You must also be
    accompanied by your identification document and driving license. If there is a second driver
    for the vehicle, he must also have all valid identification documents with him. Remember that
    you must deliver the deposit amount, unless you have already made the transfer to the
    owner.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">WHAT SHOULD I TAKE WITH ME ON THE TRIP?</h3>
    <p>That depends on you and your needs. However, some things can be agreed with the
    owner and do not hesitate to question everything you consider necessary. In many cases,
    vehicles come equipped with certain amenities that will be useful to know. Ask the owner if
    bed linen (sheets, blankets, pillowcases), kitchen kit, towels, cleaning products, etc. are
    provided.</p>
    <p>We advise you to take with you an itinerary prepared in advance: search for places of
    interest and key points - you will avoid wasting time traveling without a destination.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">ARE THERE SPECIFIC PLACES TO PARK MOTORHOMES, CAMPERVANS OR VANS?</h3>
    <p>Although it is advisable to park vehicles of this kind, especially motorhomes (due to
    their size), in places designated for that purpose, the truth is that the Driving Code provides
    that these vehicles are considered to be light vehicles (such as your personal car). Therefore,
    as long as it complies with all legal and non-abusive parking rules and does not take up more
    space than that supported by the vehicle (you cannot open the awning, the steps or even open
    windows to the sides), you can park wherever you want.</p>
    <p>We call attention to dangerous parking lots: places of poor visibility, narrow streets
    where the vehicle prevents normal circulation of other vehicles, places of geological and / or climatic risk (on the edge of cliffs, for example, or too close to others unstable geological
    structures that may collapse), streets with too much lateral inclination or slope, etc. Please
    note that a motorhome, despite being a light vehicle, is still a larger and heavier vehicle and
    requires more care.</p>
    <p>climatic risk (on the edge of cliffs, for example, or too close to others unstable geological
    structures that may collapse), streets with too much lateral inclination or slope, etc. Please
    note that a motorhome, despite being a light vehicle, is still a larger and heavier vehicle and
    requires more care.</p>
    <p>It is also important to note that, throughout the national and international territory,
    there are service stations for caravanning. In these places, it is possible to supply the water
    tanks with clean water (check if the vehicle is equipped with hoses and adapters). Most
    importantly, it is only in these places that you can dump chemical toilet waste, portable or
    not. The chemicals used are extremely toxic to the environment and only at these stations is
    it safe to clean the chemical cassette.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">ARE THERE ANY PENALTIES IF I DELAY HANDING OVER THE CAR TO THE OWNER AGAIN?</h3>
    <p>You must notify the owner of your delay and the reason for it. Depending on the
    delay, the owner reserves the right to demand an extra amount (in cases of excessive delay,
    the fee to be charged may be equivalent to an extra day of rental). These values are already
    tabulated and you can request them from Banana Campers.</p>
    <p>In any case, try to be precise on the date and time of delivery of the vehicle - it is an
    uncomfortable situation for the owner and for you, in addition to the fact that there may be
    rentals after you and the successive tenants may suffer from the inconvenience.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">DO I HAVE TO DELIVER THE VEHICLE CLEAN AND CHECK ALL LEVELS?</h3>
    <p>Just as it pleased you to receive a clean vehicle, the owner will also appreciate it.
    Imagine yourself in the reverse situation: you rented your vehicle and it was delivered filthy
    and without any care. Always check that you have all your personal items with you and that
    the vehicle has no anomalies to point out.</p>
    <p>We inform you that, if the vehicle is not delivered as received, or if previously
    established rules are not complied with, there are penalties foreseen and that must be
    deducted, by the owner, in the deposit that you delivered at the beginning of the rental:</p>

    <h3 class="text-right">IS IT POSSIBLE TO CANCEL A CONFIRMED RESERVATION?</h3>
    <p>Yes. If the cancellation of the reservation is at the initiative of the lessee, this intention
    must be communicated as early as possible:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>notice up to 30 working days before the vehicle collection day: the lessee receives
    100% of the rental amount;</li>
    <li>notice less than 30 working days before the day of collection of the vehicle: tenant
    receives 25% of the rental amount.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Attention!</strong> If no notice of intention to cancel the reservation is issued by the day before
    the day of departure, no refund will be made to the tenant.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">IS THE RENTAL CONTRACT MANDATORY?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Completion of the contract is mandatory - see it as a safeguard for both sides.
    On the platform, you will find a file that you can download and print. It contains everything
    relevant to the rental: fuel level at delivery, mileage, detailed inventory, etc. In case of
    accident or damage, only what is described in the rental contract will be taken into account.
    Therefore, we advise you to read the contract in detail and carefully and to complete it
    properly.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">IS IT NECESSARY TO MAKE AN INVENTORY?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Together with the owner, before departure, you should check all the details
    contained in the contract, as well as making sure that everything is properly inventoried. Both
    sides must sign the contract where the inventory is included. In case of damage and / or
    malfunction, only what is described in this document will be taken into account.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">HOW IS THE VEHICLE COLLECTED?</h3>
    <p>On the agreed day and time, the owner will give you the keys and a copy of the
    vehicle documents. You must receive a copy of the valid periodic technical inspection
    document, the green card (insurance) and the registration certificate. For your part, we ask
    that you present your identification document to the owner and your driving license.
    Complete the rental agreement together, and as detailed as possible, check the inventory and
    sign both copies.</p>
    <p>The owner will explain all the operation of the vehicle, and how to maintain it (how to
    fill the clean water tanks, how to clean a chemical cassette, etc.). Ask any questions you feel
    are pertinent, even if they seem obvious. You must deliver the deposit to the owner and note
    the amount paid in the contract.</p>
    <h2 class="text-center">OPERATION OF THE BANANA CAMPERS PLATFORM</h2>
    <h3 class="text-right">HOW IS THE AMOUNT THE TENANT PAYS CALCULATED?</h3>
    <p>The total amount to be paid by the lessee includes the remuneration that the owner
    of the vehicle receives and the fees associated with the use of the Banana Campers platform.
    The first amount is defined by the owner and is charged for each rental day. The second
    corresponds to a rate of 13%, which aims to remunerate the entire Banana Campers team
    that makes the platform and permanent service possible.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">WHAT TO DO IF A DOCUMENT IS REFUSED?</h3>
    <p>In this situation an email will be sent with the reason and you can proceed to its
    replacement, adding a new document. However, to avoid this type of obstacles that always
    delay our validation process, we recommend special attention to the following most common
    error situations:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Readability:</strong> pay attention to the focus, color, contrast of your document. Avoid
    submitting documents that are out of focus or which color makes it difficult to read.</li>
    <li><strong>Front and back requisition:</strong> in many cases, the document will be requested in its
    entirety, that is, the front and back of the same. When adding, make sure you meet
    this requirement.</li>
    <li><strong>Expiry:</strong> all documents added must be valid for a reasonable period. Do not submit
    documents that expire after a month, for example. The expiration of certain elements
    is crucial to keep your ad active. If the insurance document or the periodic technical
    inspection sheet expires, the advertisement will be removed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If, even taking into account all these situations, you still have difficulty receiving approval
    in all your documents, please contact us via email suporte@bananacampers.pt.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">IS IT POSSIBLE TO LEAVE A COMMENT / FEEDBACK AFTER THE RENTAL?</h3>
    <p>Not only can, but we strongly advise. The tenants\' opinions are fundamental, not only
    for the platform\'s growth, but also so that the owners can always improve in order to offer a
    superior quality service. At the end of your rental, you will receive an email with a link where
    you can share your experience and share everything that you loved (and also disliked - we are
    here to hear all opinions).</p>

    <h3 class="text-right">HOW CAN I ASK FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT A VEHICLE OF INTEREST TO ME?</h3>
    <p>Make a reservation request to the owner - it is completely free and does not make any
    commitment. When you send such requests, you can write a message to the owner, and there Make a reservation request to the owner - it is completely free and does not make any
    commitment. When you send such requests, you can write a message to the owner, and there</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">IS IT POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH THE OWNER OUTSIDE THE PLATFORM?</h3>
    <p>Yes. When making a reservation request you can send a message to the owner
    through the platform and, once he accepts your reservation, your contact details (mobile
    phone and email) will be sent him and you can continue contacting through those means.</p>
    <p>However, we reiterate that, even after your reservation request is accepted, there is
    still no binding commitment. Only after paying the rental price is the reservation confirmed.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">DO I HAVE TO BE REGISTERED AT BANANA CAMPERS TO RESERVE A VEHICLE?</h3>
    <p>To book, yes. You can search for vehicles without being registered, but in order to
    make a reservation request, you must register on the platform.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">WHAT HAPPENS AFTER MY ORDER IS ACCEPTED?</h3>
    <p>After the reservation request is confirmed by the owner, an email is sent to you,
    within a maximum period of 48 hours, to confirm the reservation by paying for it. If this
    period is exceeded, the reservation request will be deleted. If there is a real intention to
    proceed with the rental, a new reservation request will have to be made, starting the process.</p>
    <p>After paying the reservation, you will find in the “My Roadtrips” tab all the
    information about your trip and it is time to contact the owner to arrange all the details.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">THE OWNER HAS DECLINED MY RESERVATION REQUEST / THE OWNER HAS NOT RESPONDED TO MY RESERVATION REQUEST. WHAT IS THE REASON?</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately we do not control the reservation requests that our owners receive and
    subsequently accept or decline. If this happens, do not hesitate to look for other vehicles and
    make several reservation requests to those that really interest you.</p>
    <p>If, on the other hand, you have not received an answer: when a reservation request is
    made, the owners are notified by email and there, you have the option to accept or decline.
    Although we call on owners to regularly check their email inbox, the truth is that we are
    completely unaware of the whole process of accepting / declining reservations.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">THE OWNER CANCELED MY RENTAL. WHAT NOW?</h3>
    <p>Our general conditions state that, after confirming a reservation, the owner
    undertakes to guarantee its realization. Therefore, only in situations of force majeure, such as
    breakdowns, accidents or occurrences that completely immobilize the vehicle, illness or
    serious accident that prevent the delivery of the vehicle or death of the owner. Banana
    Campers must be immediately informed by the owner via email and through documents that
    attest to the veracity of the cancellation.</p>
    <p>Banana Campers will block the owner\'s remuneration and cancel the rental. After this
    procedure, we will try to find a rental solution as compatible as possible with the one you
    previously booked. Taking into account your budget and travel requirements, we will try to
    find the most suitable vehicle. If this solution is not considered, we will refund the full
    amount of the reservation.</p>
    <h2 class="text-center">PAYMENT METHODS</h2>
    <h3 class="text-right">HOW IS THE PAYMENT DONE?</h3>
    <p>You can pay your reservation through your Banana Campers account, with a bank
    card (credit or debit card). We guarantee a 100% secure payment. We mediate each and
    every payment and deal with each situation individually.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">IS IT POSSIBLE TO PAY THE OWNER DIRECTLY, AND NOT THROUGH THE PLATFORM?</h3>
    <p>No. We inform you that any way of circumventing this procedure of the platform, on
    the part of the tenant or the owner, makes the rental invalid. Banana Campers abstains from
    any and all responsibility for it and reserves the right to delete the relevant ad(s) from the
    platform, as well as to cancel the rental.</p>
    <h2 class="text-center">OTHER RELEVANT ISSUES</h2>
    <h3 class="text-right">FINES & VIA-VERDE. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THEM?</h3>
    <p>In the case of a fine (whose notification will most likely arrive after the end of the
    rental), the tenant, as the driver of the vehicle at the time of the offense, is responsible for
    paying the fine. The owner is entitled to complete a model driver identification document
    and send it to the National Road Safety Authority via registered mail or, personally, at the
    PSP District Command Offenses Section or at the Citizen Service Office of the Command
    District / Traffic Detachment of GNR, the offender\'s area of residence.</p>
    <p>In the event of improper use of Via-Verde, the owner will send the tenant a copy of
    the receipt for the dates coinciding with the rental and on which this modality was used
    without the owner\'s consent. This amount must be deducted from the deposit. If tolls are
    counted after the rental, the owner will contact the tenant and ask for the regularization of the
    amount.</p>
    <p>In case of need, Banana Campers will mediate in the settlement of outstanding
    amounts, by presenting receipts and / or invoices.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">HOW TO MANAGE THE FUEL ISSUE?</h3>
    <p>You must deliver the fuel tank at the same level as when you collected the vehicle. So,
    we suggest to the owners to deliver the full deposit - it avoids errors and rounding. If, when
    the vehicle is returned, the fuel level does not match what was delivered, the owner can
    deduct the difference in the amount of the deposit, to be confirmed with the respective
    receipt from the gas station.</p>
    <h3 class="text-right">WHAT TO DO IF THERE ARE DELAYS IN RETURNING THE VEHICLE?</h3>
    <p>Any delay (equal to or greater than 1h30) in returning the vehicle is billed as follows:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>01h30 to 05h00 after the agreed time: the owner can charge 12 € for each hour of
    delay.</li>
    <li>After 5:00 am of the agreed time: the owner can charge the renter an extra day
    (corresponds to the daily tariff defined and contracted).</li>
    </ul>
