<h2 class="text-center">FIRST STEPS</h2>
<h3 class="text-right">WHO ARE WE?</h3>
<P>Banana Campers is a platform that unites, in a simple and intuitive way, owners of motorhomes and vans and individuals who want to rent vehicles for a defined period of time. We are guided by key principles, which are based on ideals of mutual assistance, seriousness and tranquility, always promoted and mediated by professionals. We promote fair and affordable prices, easy communication and a safe environment for both sides to benefit as much as possible from the experience.</P>
<P>If you are an owner, please be aware that we are at your complete disposal by email suporte@bananacampers.pt. We are here to clarify any doubts that may arise, answer questions that you consider relevant and even listen to suggestions and complaints.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">DOES AN AD SUBMISSION TO BANANA CAMPERS HAVE ANY ASSOCIATED COSTS?</h3>
<P>No. Joining our community will incur no cost to the owner. The costs of using our platform will be charged to the tenant in the form of administrative fees. As an owner, we only ask that you place your ad as real as possible (the vehicle you are advertising must match the actual vehicle).</P>
<h3 class="text-right">CAN I AT ANY TIME BE EXEMPT FROM THE PERIODIC TECHNICAL INSPECTION?</h3>
<P>Yes. All vehicles advertised at Banana Campers must have a valid Periodic Technical Inspection document to allow them to circulate. Without this document, the rental cannot be made and the advertisement will be temporarily inactive (until the new valid document is sent). Note that this document does not exist in the following vehicles:</P>

<p>*Please note that the age of the vehicle must be determined from the date of registration and not the year of registration, ie if you register a 9-year-old vehicle in Spain this year, the age of the vehicle only starts to count from the year you enrolled it in a different country.</p>

<P>If your vehicle is exempt from the Periodic Technical Inspection, please indicate in your ad the year in which the first inspection should be made.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">HOW CAN I SIGN UP FOR BANANA CAMPERS?</h3>
<P>Just quick, simple and free small steps are enough for you to belong to our community. Access our website bananacampers.pt, click on “Register”, fill in all the fields presented and immediately you can start creating your ad. Try to make the profile as complete as possible</P>
<h2 class="text-center">TRAVEL INSURANCE AND ASSISTANCE</h2>
<h3 class="text-right">CAN ANYONE RENT MY VEHICLE?</h3>
<P>No. For the safety of both sides, we have defined a set of criteria: the lessee must be 25 years of age or older, to be verified when submitting documents on the platform; hold a driving license, which you have held for at least 3 years; make exclusively private use of the vehicle you rent (that is, you cannot sub-rent a vehicle that has been rented).</P>
<h3 class="text-right">SHOULD I INSURE MY VEHICLE WITH AN INSURANCE COMPANY DEAL OF MY CHOICE?</h3>
<P>At the moment, we are working with our partners in Portugal to find an own damage insurance solution with affordable prices for the rental of motorhomes and personal vans. Soon we will make available all the information regarding the insurance that your vehicle will be subject to while rented under Banana Campers.</P>
<P>Even so, all vehicles registered with Banana Campers must have a valid insurance policy, and this will be in effect to proceed with the car rentals. The lessee must be previously informed of the conditions covered by the policy in force, namely the deductible, if it is an insurance against all risks, what is the policy of travel assistance, etc.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">IS THERE A DEPOSIT ASSOCIATED WITH THE RENTAL?</h3>
<P>Yes. The guarantee deposit is delivered to the owner when the vehicle is collected. Its value is defined by you, with no minimum or maximum limits. Beware that the amount required must be sufficient to cover most of the recurring damage from a rental. However, also keep in mind that security values that are too high can deter potential tenants. Thus, the values practiced on our platform, range from 400 € to 2000 €.</P>
<P>The amount of the guarantee deposit must be indicated in advance in the ad. You must also specify the preferred payment method (cash, transfer, PayPal, etc.). Please notethat interbank transfers or between banks in different countries take a few business days to complete, so you can request proof of transfer from the lessee.</P>
<P>The deposit amount will appear on the copies of the contract of both sides. Any and all changes to the return of the total amount of the deposit must be included in the contract of the owner and the tenant and must be duly signed by both, to prove with invoices.</P>
<P>The deposit safeguards the owner from any damage caused by the lessee that does not involve the insurance being triggered (bedding, kitchen utensils, breaks in the furniture of the vehicle, failure of essential elements contained in the delivered inventory and that must be returned, etc.). It can be used when the tenant exceeds the previously contracted mileage, any toll / porches / via-verde passages, and fines and filling the fuel level if, when the vehicle is delivered, it is not at the previously agreed level (we suggest that you deliver the full tank and clarifies that it must be delivered full).</P>
<P>If <strong>no damage is detected</strong> when returning the vehicle:<br>
After checking the condition of the vehicle, if there is no damage to be pointed out, the owner must return the total amount of the deposit to the tenants. In cases of fines that, for other reasons, the owner is notified after the end of the rental, Banana Campers compromises to request an immediate regularization from the tenant.</P>
<P>If <strong>damage is detected</strong> when returning the vehicle:<br>
In the event that damage is detected when the van is returned, the owner must retain the full amount of the deposit. You should then request a quote for the respective repair and inform Banana Campers, through the means provided, of the same. Damage to the vehicle must appear on both copies of the contract, equally, and signed by the owner and the lessee.</P>
<P>We advise you to always check the vehicle\'s mileage, as well as the fuel tank, in order to check if it corresponds to the previously agreed. If not, the amounts must be deducted from the deposit.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF ACCIDENT / DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE?</h3>
<P>First of all, it is essential that the rental contract is duly completed and signed by both sides. All points subject to repair must be explained in the most detailed way possible. Retain the full amount of the deposit. You must then request a quote for the repair of the damage caused by the tenant and, after informing him and having his consent, you must proceed with the repair, always using the amount of the deposit you have retained.</P>
<P>In situations of damage not falling under the category “minor damage”, please contact Banana Campers. If there is also a situation of conflict or difficulty in communicating with the tenant, please request our intervention in order to mediate the dialogue.</P>
<P>If damage is found after the rental agreement has been drawn up (consequently not marked in the same), please contact the tenant and expose the problem(s). If they are accepted by the lessee, both sides must add this to their version of the contract previously entered into. If the tenants refrain from taking responsibility for possible damages detected after the contract is signed, Banana Campers is not responsible for it, as well as abstaining from intervention in the situation. Therefore, we advise that the return of the vehicle and its analysis is carried out as thoroughly as possible.</P>
<h2 class="text-center">RENTAL PROCEDURES</h2>
<h3 class="text-right">RENTAL PROCEDURES</h3>
<P>Yes. Completion of the contract is mandatory - see it as a safeguard for both sides. On the platform, you will find a file that you can download and print. It contains everything relevant to the rental: fuel level at delivery, mileage, detailed inventory, etc. In case of accident or damage, only what is described in the rental contract will be taken into account.</P>
<P>Therefore, we advise you to read the contract in detail and carefully and to complete it properly. You can make a prior list of what you want to include, such as the inventory of kitchen utensils or vehicle accessory equipment, to prevent any forgetfulness.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">I HAVEN\'T RECEIVED THE RENTAL DOCUMENTS YET. WHAT COULD BE THE CAUSE?</h3>
<P>Before sending the rental contract, there are parameters that must be checked: whether the payment and the confirmation of the reservation were made by the lessee; whether all documents of the owner are duly verified; if all documents that are required of the tenant are already submitted and validated.</P>
<P>If any of your documents are not validated by Banana Campers before booking, please contact us via email suporte@bananacampers.pt</P>
<P>In the "My reservations" tab you will find the link to download the documents required for printing. If they are not available 48 hours before the start of the reservation, we ask that you contact us as soon as possible.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">CLEANING THE VEHICLE, AS WELL AS CHECKING THE WATER, OIL, ETC. LEVELS: IS IT MY RESPONSIBILITY?</h3>
<P>Yes. With minor exceptions, the vehicle must be delivered properly cleaned and sanitized. Reverse the situation: how would you like to find a vehicle you just rented? In addition, the state in which the tenants find the vehicle when they receive it can, in many cases, reflect the state in which they are going to deliver it.</P>
<P>However, if it detects, when the vehicle returns, extreme external and / or internal dirt, or a non-compliance with previously agreed rules, it can retain a value corresponding to the sum of the applicable values tabulated below:</P>

<h3 class="text-right">WHAT SHOULD I CONSIDER BEFORE DELIVERY OF THE VEHICLE?</h3>
<P>First, gather all the documents that will be needed: rental agreement, vehicle inventory, vehicle documents (valid insurance policy, copies of vehicle registration documents and Periodic Technical Inspection form when applicable). Check carefully that the vehicle is clean, including chemical toilet cassettes, that there are enough liquids / chemicals to be replaced by the tenant, the dirty water tanks are empty and the clean water tanks are full. Make sure that the engine\'s gas, oil and water levels are impeccable. Top up the fuel tank. Make sure that all the elements you mentioned in the ad are present: towels, bed linen, set of pans and kitchen utensils, etc.</P>
<P>When the tenant arrives, ask him to identify himself through a valid identification document (identity card, passport, driving license). Then explain as much as possible how the vehicle works (how to turn on the gas from the stove, how to check the different levels, how to maintain the cassette, etc.). Fill out and sign the rental agreement with the tenant. The deposit must be delivered by the tenant, using the means previously described in the advertisement.</P>
<P><strong>Important note:</strong> the contract must be signed and the inventory reviewed BEFORE the vehicle leaves</P>
<h3 class="text-right">HOW IS THE VEHICLE RETURNED?</h3>
<P>Must be established a date and an hour, between you and the tenant. The delivery date should be suitable for both sides, but you can choose a period that is more favorable to you, for example: from 8 am to 12 pm or until 8 pm. Note that these times are indicative only. We advise you to talk to the tenant about them, as well as to avoid very awake hours - do not forget that the tenant is paying for the day in question and it is not correct to return the vehicle until 10 am, for example, except in situations exceptional. On the other hand, you must notify the tenant that the limit for returning the vehicle, except for exceptions previously discussed with the same, is until 20:00.</P>
<P>Regarding the collection period of the vehicle, we suggest asking the tenant if you prefer the morning (from 9:30 am) or the afternoon (from 2:30 pm).</P>
<h2 class="text-center">MY AD</h2>
<h3 class="text-right">WHAT REQUIREMENTS ARE ASKED FOR THE SUBMISSION OF MY AD?</h3>
<P>We require vehicles that are fully functional, meticulously maintained and checked and are in an impeccable state of conservation. Complete vehicle safety is imperative. In addition, all documents (registration certificate, periodic technical inspection document and insurance) must be updated, legal and with a wide validity.</P>
<P>Your remuneration will correspond to the multiplication of the tariff you define by the number of days of the rental (the days of collection and return of the vehicle are included). To that amount, fees, defined by Banana Campers, will be added, which will correspond to the costs of using the platform and which will be the responsibility of the tenant.</P>
<P>You can set the rates you want, but remember that renting at the fairest price can result in a higher number of rentals. We recommend a little research to get an idea of the prices charged by the other owners and then adjust it to its fair value. You can change the fare value to “high season” or “low season” if you wish. However, keep in mind that constant changes will affect your rentals (if they coincide with a transition period) and also their number (uncertain and constantly updating prices can be a deterrent to tenants).</P>
<h3 class="text-right">WHAT DOCUMENTS ARE REQUIRED WHEN REGISTERING / SUBMITTING AN AD?</h3>
<p>Your account will only be validated after you provide us with the following documents and your verification is complete:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your valid identification document (Identity Card, passport, etc., front and back); Proof of residence (the document must have been issued within a maximum period of 3 months);</li>
<li>Document of periodic technical inspection of the vehicle (s) announced;</li>
<li>Green card (insurance) for the vehicle (s) announced;</li>
<li>Registration certificate for the vehicle (s) announced</li>
</ul>
<p>The submission of these documents can be done by scanning the same or a photo with as much quality as possible. Try the jpeg, jpg or pdf formats (maximum 1Mb).</p>
<p>As with tenants, all owner documents must be duly submitted and validated by Banana Campers up to 48 hours before the rental, otherwise we cannot issue the rental contract and the reservation will be canceled.</p>
<h3 class="text-right">WHAT TO DO IF A DOCUMENT IS REFUSED?</h3>
<P>In this situation an email will be sent with the reason and you can proceed to its replacement, adding a new document. However, to avoid this type of obstacles that always delay our validation process, we recommend special attention to the following most common error situations:</P>
<ul>
<li><strong>Readability</strong>: pay attention to the focus, color, contrast of your document. Avoid submitting documents that are out of focus or which color makes it difficult to read.</li>
<li><strong>Front and back requisition</strong>: in many cases, the document will be requested in its
entirety, that is, the front and back of the same. When adding, make sure you meet
this requirement.</li>
<li><strong>Expiry</strong>: all documents added must be valid for a reasonable period. Do not submit documents that expire after a month, for example. The expiration of certain elements is crucial to keep your ad active. If the insurance document or the periodic technical inspection sheet expires, the advertisement will be removed</li>
</ul>
<p>If, even taking into account all these situations, you still have difficulty receiving approval in all your documents, please contact us via email suporte@bananacampers.pt.</p>
<h3 class="text-right">IS THERE A MINIMUM AGE FOR THE VEHICLE TO ADVERTISE IT?</h3>
<P>No. As long as the vehicle is impeccably maintained and has regular and thorough maintenance, whether mechanical or interior / exterior, there is no reason not to advertise.</P>
<P>While some tenants will prefer modern and newer vehicles, others will not resist the vintage appeal of older vehicles. The same applies to people who prefer the comfort of a motorhome or to others who, on the other hand, prefer the more practical aspect of vans.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">WHAT TO DO IF I SELL MY VEHICLE?</h3>
<P>If you are monetizing your vehicle through rentals and it is the only purpose that you give it, the possibility of sale may arise. In such cases, we ask only to be aware of future reservations or reservation requests. If you already know when your business will be processed, we ask that you block the calendar dates for that vehicle (you can choose to block from a specific day, week, fortnight or even month). We remind you that, as soon as you accept a reservation request, you are making a commitment to another person that this rental will take place.</P>
<P>After verifying that you have no pending reservations or reservation requests, you can delete the ad. We remind you that Banana Campers is not responsible for unsuccessful rentals if the sale is not communicated by the owner to the platform and the tenants in a timely manner.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">WHAT TO DO IF I CAN\'T ADD PHOTOS TO MY AD?</h3>
<P>First, check the chosen format. Images must end in .jpeg or .png. The size and weight of the photograph is also important: very small / reduced or very low resolution images will be rejected by the platform.</P>
<P>On the other hand, avoid adding excessively large or high quality. We advise you to adjust the size and / or quality of the image. Then, try adding again. If the problem persists, send us your photos to suporte@bananacampers.pt and we will add them to your ad.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">HOW DOES DATE BLOCKING WORK ON THE VEHICLE\'S CALENDAR?</h3>
<P>It is essential to keep the vehicle\'s calendar updated to avoid booking requests on dates when the vehicle is not available for hire. This includes periods when you intend to take advantage of it in a personal interest, overhauls and repairs / mechanical or interior / exterior maintenance, breakdowns or any other reason that, in your view, is a hindrance for the vehicle to be rented.</P>
<P>Therefore, go to the advertisement page, open the vehicle\'s calendar and select the dates between which the vehicle is not available, indicating the reason.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">WHO MANAGES MY AD?</h3>
<P>The management of an ad already created is done intuitively and autonomously by you. It is your responsibility to add vehicle documents, photographs and set the fare you will be charged. Manage and update the calendar as you see fit and define each rental parameter, such as the deposit, rental requirements (allowed or not to smoke, pets allowed, etc.). Define and list everything the vehicle is equipped with. To do this, simply fill out carefully and in detail all the fields presented to you when creating the ad.</P>
<h2 class="text-center">PAYMENT</h2>
<h3 class="text-right">HOW IS THE RENTAL FEE PAID TO ME?</h3>
<P>The amount you will receive for each rental will be paid to you by bank transfer, which is authorized by Banana Campers on the second rental day (after we confirm that the rental is, in fact, in progress). After the order for the transfer has been deliberated, it is subject to the common times of the banking entities to process these transactions (3 to 4 business days). So, count on the money in your account between 3 to 7 working days after the second day of the rental.</P>
<P>You must provide your bank details (IBAN and BIC) for the account to which you want payments to be transferred. We inform you that this type of confidential information is only used to pay for your rentals. The IBAN corresponds to a set of 27 digits that correspond to the international form of the NIB (only a prefix of 4 characters is placed. The one for Portugal, for example, is PT50).</P>
<h3 class="text-right">HOW DO I CALCULATE THE REMUNERATION I RECEIVE FOR EACH RENTAL?</h3>
<P>The remuneration you will receive in your bank account is the result of a direct multiplication of your daily value practiced by the number of full rental days. That is, imagine that you charge € 49.99 per day. If we are talking about a 5-day rental, then your remuneration will be 49.99 x 5 = € 249.95.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">WHY DOESN\'T THE TENANT PAY ME DIRECTLY?</h3>
<P>The payment of a booking request is the only way that links the tenant to the rental with which he has committed. It is a guarantee for the owner, who is sure that the rental will be made and that the contact is not the result of mere curiosity, but also for the tenant who, once he pays to an external mediating entity, knows that his money is only will be released after the rental starts. In addition, there are administrative fees that apply to those who use the platform to rent vehicles and this amount is charged to the lessee.</P>
<P>We inform you that any way of circumventing this procedure of the platform, by the tenant or the owner, makes the rental invalid. Banana Campers disclaims any and all liability therefore and reserves the right to exclude the relevant ad(s) from the platform.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">HOW IS THE PAYMENT PROCESSED TO THE TENANT?</h3>
<P>After sending the reservation request and acceptance by the owner, the lessee is notified to proceed with the payment, via bank card, of the reservation, in order to confirm it.</P>
<h2 class="text-center">OPERATION OF THE SITE</h2>
<h3 class="text-right">WHAT ADDITIONAL FEES ARE CHARGED TO THE TENANT?</h3>
<P>The following amounts are included in the total amount paid by the lessee: his remuneration and a 13% fee for services / use of the platform. The latter serves to pay everyone who makes the Banana Campers website possible.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">HOW LONG DOES THE TENANT HAVE TO CONFIRM THE RESERVATION?</h3>
<P>After the reservation request is confirmed by the owner, an email is sent to the tenant so that, within a maximum period of 48 hours, the reservation can be confirmed by paying the reservation. If this period is exceeded, the reservation request will be deleted. If there is a real intention to proceed with the rental, a new reservation request will have to be made, starting the process.</P>
<P>It is important to note that, even if you accept several coincident booking requests (the platform does not block dates only based on a rental request), the first reservation to be confirmed will cancel the remaining orders and permanently block the dates.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">AM I NOTIFIED WHEN A NEW BOOKING REQUEST APPEARS?</h3>
<P>Yes. You will be immediately notified by email and, in it, you will find the link that will direct you to the website bananacampers.pt, where you can accept or refuse the request.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">WHY IS MY AD DEACTIVATED?</h3>
<P>We work so that our platform offers a positive and safe experience, for both owners and tenants. Therefore, your ad may be disabled for the following reasons:</P>
<ul>
<li>You refused, without being justified by any update to the calendar, a significant number of reservation requests.</li>
<li>You did not respond, positive or negative, to a significant number of reservation requests.</li>
<li>When we verify that the validity date of your documents has expired (periodic technical inspection document, insurance policy, identification document, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="text-right">IS IT POSSIBLE TO CANCEL A CONFIRMED RESERVATION?</h3>
<P>No, except in situations of force majeure. We inform you that if you cancel a confirmed reservation without providing a valid and written justification for it, an indemnity of 180 € of the remuneration of the next rental will be retained for the platform. Exceptional situations are considered: malfunctions, accidents or occurrences that completely immobilize the vehicle, illness or serious accident that prevent the delivery of the vehicle or death.</P>
<P>Banana Campers must be informed immediately of any and all impediments to the rental of the vehicle. This notice must be made in writing, via email, and the written justification for that purpose must be attached to it.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">IF A CONFIRMED RESERVATION IS CANCELED, HOW IS THE REFUND PROCESSED?</h3>
<P>If the owner, without any justification or apparent reason (except for the cases of force majeure mentioned above), cancels a previously confirmed reservation, an indemnity will be retained, for and by the Banana Campers platform, of 180 €. This amount will be deducted from the remuneration of the next rental.</P>
<P>If the reservation is canceled by the lessee, this intention must be communicated as early as possible:</P>
<ul>
<li>Notice up to 30 working days before the vehicle collection day: the lessee receives 100% of the rental amount;</li>
<li>Notice less than 30 working days before the day of collection of the vehicle: tenant receives 25% of the rental amount;</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="text-right">WHAT DOCUMENTS MUST THE TENANT BRING ON THE DAY THE VEHICLE IS COLLECTED?</h3>
<P>Upon departure, the lessee must have in his possession:</P>
<ul>
<li>A valid identification document;</li>
<li>A valid driving license;</li>
<li>A valid driving license;</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="text-center">OTHER RELEVANT ISSUES</h2>
<h3 class="text-right">DO PROFITS HAVE TO BE DECLARED?</h3>
<P>The declaration of all profits obtained from rentals through the Banana Campers platform is the sole responsibility of the owner, as well as the issuing of invoices to the tenants.</P>
<h3 class="text-right">FINES & VIA-VERDE. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THEM?</h3>
<P>In the case of a fine (whose notification will most likely arrive after the end of the rental), the tenant, as the driver of the vehicle at the time of the offense, is responsible for paying the fine. As owner, you have 45 days from receipt of the fine notification to contest the fine. To do this, you must complete a driver identification template and:</P>
<ul>
<li>send, by registered mail, to the Autoridade Nacional de Segurança Rodoviária (Parque de Ciências e Tecnologia de Oeiras, Avenida de Casal de Cabanas, Urbanização de Cabanas Golf, n.º 1 , Tagus Park, 2734-507 Barcarena)</li>
<li>Personally in the Secção de Contraordenações do Comando Distrital da PSP ou no Gabinete de Atendimento ao Cidadão do Comando Distrital/Destacamento de Trânsito da GNR, in the offender\'s area of residence.</li>
</ul>
<P>Personally in the Secção de Contraordenações do Comando Distrital da PSP ou no Gabinete de Atendimento ao Cidadão do Comando Distrital/Destacamento de Trânsito da GNR, in the offender\'s area of residence.</P>
<p>In the case of improper use of Via-Verde, you must send the tenant a copy of the receipt for the dates coinciding with the rental and on which this modality was used without the owner\'s consent. This amount must be deducted from the deposit. If tolls are counted after rental, we ask that you contact the tenant and ask for the regularization of the amount.</p>
<h3 class="text-right">WHAT TO DO IF THERE ARE DELAYS IN RETURNING THE VEHICLE?</h3>
<P>Any delay (equal to or greater than 1h30) in returning the vehicle is billed as follows:</P>
<ul>
<li>01h30 to 05h00 after the agreed time: the owner can charge 12 € for each hour of delay.</li>
<li>After 5:00h after the agreed time: the owner can charge the renter an extra day (corresponds to the daily tariff defined and contracted).</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="text-right">HOW TO MANAGE THE FUEL ISSUE?</h3>
<P>The tenant must deliver the fuel tank at the same level as when the vehicle was collected. Therefore, we suggest that you deliver the full deposit - avoid errors and rounding. If, when the vehicle is returned, the fuel level does not match what was delivered, you can deduct the difference in the amount of the deposit, to be confirmed with the respective receipt from the filling station.</P>

Even so, all vehicles registered with Banana Campers must have a valid insurance policy, and this will be in effect to proceed with the car rentals. The lessee must be previously informed of the conditions covered by the policy in force, namely the deductible, if it is an insurance against all risks, what is the policy of travel assistance, etc.";

$lang["faq_mt2_d3"] = "Yes. The guarantee deposit is delivered to the owner when the vehicle is collected. Its value is defined by you, with no minimum or maximum limits. Beware that the amount required must be sufficient to cover most of the recurring damage from a rental. However, also keep in mind that security values that are too high can deter potential tenants. Thus, the values practiced on our platform, range from 400 € to 2000 €.
The amount of the guarantee deposit must be indicated in advance in the ad. You must also specify the preferred payment method (cash, transfer, PayPal, etc.). Please notethat interbank transfers or between banks in different countries take a few business days to complete, so you can request proof of transfer from the lessee.
The deposit amount will appear on the copies of the contract of both sides. Any and all changes to the return of the total amount of the deposit must be included in the contract of the owner and the tenant and must be duly signed by both, to prove with invoices.
The deposit safeguards the owner from any damage caused by the lessee that does not involve the insurance being triggered (bedding, kitchen utensils, breaks in the furniture of the vehicle, failure of essential elements contained in the delivered inventory and that must be returned, etc.). It can be used when the tenant exceeds the previously contracted mileage,any toll / porches / via-verde passages, and fines and filling the fuel level if, when the vehicle is delivered, it is not at the previously agreed level (we suggest that you deliver the full tank and clarifies that it must be delivered full).
If <strong>no damage is detected</strong> when returning the vehicle:
After checking the condition of the vehicle, if there is no damage to be pointed out, the owner must return the total amount of the deposit to the tenants. In cases of fines that, for other reasons, the owner is notified after the end of the rental, Banana Campers compromises to request an immediate regularization from the tenant.
If <strong>damage is detected</strong> when returning the vehicle:
In the event that damage is detected when the van is returned, the owner must retain the full amount of the deposit. You should then request a quote for the respective repair and inform Banana Campers, through the means provided, of the same. Damage to the vehicle must appear on both copies of the contract, equally, and signed by the owner and the lessee.
We advise you to always check the vehicle's mileage, as well as the fuel tank, in order to check if it corresponds to the previously agreed. If not, the amounts must be deducted from the deposit.";

In situations of damage not falling under the category “minor damage”, please contact Banana Campers. If there is also a situation of conflict or difficulty in communicating with the tenant, please request our intervention in order to mediate the dialogue. 
If damage is found after the rental agreement has been drawn up (consequently not marked in the same), please contact the tenant and expose the problem(s). If they are accepted by the lessee, both sides must add this to their version of the contract previously entered into. If the tenants refrain from taking responsibility for possible damages detected after the contract is signed, Banana Campers is not responsible for it, as well as abstaining from intervention in the situation.

We advise you to talk to the tenant about them, as well as to avoid very awake hours - do not forget that the tenant is paying for the day in question and it is not correct to return the vehicle until 10 am, for example, except in situations exceptional. On the other hand, you must notify the tenant that the limit for returning the vehicle, except for exceptions previously discussed with the same, is until 20:00.
Regarding the collection period of the vehicle, we suggest asking the tenant if you prefer the morning (from 9:30 am) or the afternoon (from 2:30 pm).";
